### Greetings 👋

- I'm Leo Gabrielsson, a young man hailing from Sweden 🇸🇪 and currently studying at [TE4 Umeå](https://github.com/TE4-Umea) where me and my peers work to better our understanding of web development and programming.
- My programming languages are: Java and JavaScript, the markup language HTML, and CSS (+ a bit of Nunjucks). I prefer to work in HTML, CSS and javaScript alot more than to work in Java.
- I'm fluent in both Swedish and English.
- Will add a link to my portfolio when I'm done with it
